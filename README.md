# Resources for COVID-19 hospital impact modelling

This repo is just a place store some notes and code related to c19
hospital impact modeling. Some of the work is based on the amazing CHIME
project. 

## CHIME project

* [Online hospital impact simulator](https://penn-chime.phl.io/)
* [https://github.com/CodeForPhilly/chime](https://github.com/CodeForPhilly/chime)
* [CHIME docs](https://code-for-philly.gitbook.io/chime/)
* [Announcing CHIME blog post](http://predictivehealthcare.pennmedicine.org/2020/03/14/accouncing-chime.html)

## Some stuff I created that's in this repo

### run_sim_chime_scenario.py

We adapted the CLI application in the CHIME project (https://github.com/CodeForPhilly/chime).

- added scenario and output_path parameters (separate from main Parameters object)
- added ability to use an input file, command line args, or DEFAULTS to instantiate model
- added ability to import this and call sim_chime() function from external apps so that we can run tons of scenarios over ranges of input parameters
- output is a dictionary of the standard CHIME dataframes as well as dictionaries
containing parameter and variable values.
- also writes out csvs of the dataframes and json for the dictionaries

### Cheat sheets for installing CHIME locally

The docs for CHIME are great. I created this to help folks with limited
exposure to this kind of stuff get CHIME installed in either Windows or Linux.
The hospital based analysts we are trying to help with this work are all on Windows.

### Jupyter notebook version of early CHIME model

**NOTE: This was based on a very early version of the CHIME model. Nevertheless,
the comments might still be useful to someone trying to understand the basic
logic of the model.**

I've added tons of code comments and other descriptive text throughout the notebook to help others understand exactly how this works and how we might adapt it for our use.

### Jupyter notebook for downloading COVID-19 time series data

Downloads latest time series data from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.

- does a bunch of data wrangling to create global as well as US datasets (at county and state level) that are amenable to analysis
- all dataframes are created both in semi-wide and long forms. The semi-wide forms have been date melted but contain separate columns for confirmed, deaths, and recovered. The long forms are measure melted in addition to date melted.
- csvs explorted to path of your choosing
- basic line plot at bottom for demo.

## Johns Hopkins projects

* [https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
    - do git pull to get updated data including daily and time series (csv)
    - for US can get data both at state and county level 
    - [Dashboard](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6)
    - links to Lancet article and many data sources
